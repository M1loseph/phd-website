## PHD Website

A personal website written entirely in Flutter.

### List of cool features
- Support for more than one language (using `intl` package).
- Saving preferences on client side using Local Storage (underlying technology in `SharedPreferences` package).
- Easter Eggs 🥚🐇.

### Warning for the future

If you ever want to create a simple website with just a bunch of pages and simple routing - don't use flutter. Use anything else. Just not flutter. It's not worth it.
