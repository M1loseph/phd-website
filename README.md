## PHD Website

A personal website written entirely in Flutter.

### List of cool features
- Support for more than one language (using `intl` package).
- Saving preferences on client side using Local Storage (underlying technology in `SharedPreferences` package).
- Easter Eggs ü•öüêá.

### Running and building the project

Run the project simply pressing `run` above main method in VS Code. Flutter extension is required. On the bottom panel select chrome as a target. 

You can also run it from command line: `flutter run` and then select web browser as a device.

Building a release is also super simple. Simply run `flutter build web`. This script is saved in `tools` directory just in case.


### Dev notes

#### 1. Warning for the future

If you ever want to create a simple website with just a bunch of pages and simple routing - don't use flutter. Use anything else. Just not flutter. It's not worth it.

#### 2. Profile mode

Profiling on "profile" build doesn't work on chrome (so i guess it doesn't work on web target at all). Yet another reason not to use flutter for anything serious on the web.
